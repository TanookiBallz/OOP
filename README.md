The Book class has four attributes (title, author, ISBN, price), and two constructors: a default one that sets values to defaults and a parameterized one to initialize with specific values.

displayInfo() prints the book details.
applyDiscount() reduces the price by a given percentage.
In the main method, three Book objects are created (one with default values, two with specific values). The displayInfo() method displays the details, and applyDiscount() applies a discount to one book's price.
